          <b><span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">ἔγχος</span></b> , <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">εος</span>: <span class="alpheios-lex-gloss">spear, lance;</span> used for both hurling
          and thrusting, and regarded as the most honorable weapon; the shaft,
            <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">δόρυ</span>, was of ash, about 7 ft. long;
          the upper end, <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">καυλός</span>, was fitted with
          a bronze socket, <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">αὐλός</span>, into which the
          point, <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">ἀκωκή, αἰχμῄ</span>, was inserted,
            <i><span class="en">Il. 16.802</span></i>, being held fast by the
            <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">πόρκης</span>; the lower end, <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">οὐρίαχος</span>, was furnished with a ferule or
          spike, <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">σαυρωτήρ</span>, for sticking into the
          earth. The warrior usually carried two spears—for hurling, at a
          distance of about 12 paces, and for thrusting from above. Hector's
          spear was 16 ft. long, <i><span class="en">Il. 6.319</span></i>. (See
          also <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">σῦριγξ</span>, and cut 19.)</div> <div class="alpheios-lex-footnotes en"> </div>
