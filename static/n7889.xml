          <b><span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">Ποσειδά̄ων</span></b> :
            <span class="alpheios-lex-gloss">Poseidon</span> (Neptūnus), son of Cronus and Rhea, brother
          of Zeus, Hades, etc., and husband of Amphitrīte. As god of the sea,
          the element assigned to him by lot (<i><span class="en">Il.
            15.189</span></i>), he sends winds and storms, moves the waters with his
          trident, and causes earthquakes, <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">ἐνοσίχθων,
            ἐννοσίγαιος, γαιήοχος</span>. To him, as to Hades, black bulls
          were sacrificed, <i><span class="en">Od. 3.6</span></i>; cf. the
          epithet <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">κῡανοχαίτης</span>. Poseidon is the
          enemy of the Trojans in consequence of the faithlessness of Laomedon,
            <i><span class="en">Il. 21.443</span></i> ff.; and of Odysseus,
          because of the blinding of Polyphēmus, his son, <i><span class="en">Od. 1.20</span></i>. His dwelling is in the depths of
          the sea near Aegae, <i><span class="en">Il. 13.21</span></i>, <i><span class="en">Od. 5.381</span></i>; but he attends the assembly of
          the gods on Olympus, <i><span class="en">Il. 8.440</span></i>, <i><span class="en">Il. 15.161</span></i>.</div> <div class="alpheios-lex-footnotes en"> </div>
