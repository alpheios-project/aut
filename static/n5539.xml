          <b><span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">κρητήρ</span></b> , <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">ῆρος</span> (<span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">κεράννῡμι</span>):
            <span class="alpheios-lex-gloss">mixingbowl, wassail-bowl</span>, in which wine and water
          were mingled, to be distributed in cups; two parts of wine to three of
          water was a common mixture; <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">κρητῆρα μίσγεσθαι,
            στήσασθαι</span>, ‘set up,’ place at hand. The wassail-bowl was
          usually placed near the hearth, and often on a tripod (esp. when
          several <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">κρητῆρες</span> were in use at the
          banquet); the contents were poured into the cups (<span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">δέπαα</span>) by means of a filler (<span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">πρόχοος</span>, pitcher), <i><span class="en">Od. 3.339</span></i>. Cut No. 8 shows (1) the <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">ἀμφιφορεύς</span>, from which the wine was poured into the
          upper, smaller mixing-bowl, on which the <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">πρόχοος</span> stands. The second mixing-bowl served to contain
          the water, and then the contents of both bowls may be imagined as
          mixed in the largest bowl, which stands upon the tripod, and from
          which the diluted wine was distributed. (Cf. cut No. 26.)</div> <div class="alpheios-lex-footnotes en"> </div>
