            <span class="alpheios-lex-gloss">Phaeacians</span>, a fabulous people related to the gods,
          dwelling in Scheria, where they lived a life of ease, averse to war
          and devoted to sea-faring. The ships in which they escort guests to
          their homes, however distant, are themselves possessed of intelligence
          to find the way. The names of nearly all the Phaeacians mentioned are
          significant of the love of ships, not excepting that of Nausicaa
            (<span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">ναῦς</span>), the most charming of them
