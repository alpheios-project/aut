            <span class="alpheios-lex-gloss">about</span> to do something, foll. by fut. inf., sometimes
          pres., rarely aor., <i><span class="en">Il. 23.773</span></i>
          ; <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">μέλλω</span> never means to
          intend, although intention is of course sometimes implied, <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">τῇ γὰρ ἔμελλε διεξίμεναι πεδίονδε</span>, ‘for by
          that gate he was going to pass out,’ <i><span class="en">Il.
            6.393</span></i>; by destiny as it were, of something that was or was
          not <span class="alpheios-lex-gloss">meant</span> to happen, <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">Κύκλωψ, οὐκ
            ἄρ᾽ ἔμελλες ἀνάλκιδος ἀνδρὸς ἑταίρους</span> | <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">ἔδμεναι</span>, ‘you were not going to eat the
          comrades of a man unable to defend himself after all,’ i. e. he was no
          coward whose companions you undertook to eat, and therefore it was not
            <span class="alpheios-lex-gloss">meant</span> that you should eat them with impunity, <i><span class="en">Od. 9.475</span></i>, and often similarly. Virtually
          the same is the usage that calls for <span class="alpheios-lex-gloss">must</span> in
          paraphrasing, <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">οὕτω που Διὶ μέλλει ὑπερμενέϊ
            φίλον εἶναι</span>, such methinks ‘must’ be the will of Zeus;
            <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">τὰ δὲ μέλλετ᾽ ἀκουέμεν</span>, ye ‘must’
          have heard, <i><span class="en">Il. 2.116</span></i>, <i><span class="en">Il. 14.125</span></i>, <i><span class="en">Od.
