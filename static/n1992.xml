          <b><span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">γέ</span></b> : enclitic particle, used to
          give prominence to a word or a statement; sometimes to be translated,
            <span class="alpheios-lex-gloss">at least, at any rate</span>, but for the most part
          untranslatable, and only to be represented in English orally by the
          tone, in writing by italics; <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">εἰ ζωόν γ᾽ Αἴγισθον
            ἐνὶ μεγάροισιν ἔτετμεν</span> | <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">Ἀτρείδης</span>, ‘had Menelāus found Aegisthus at home
            <span class="alpheios-lex-gloss">alive!</span>’ <i><span class="en">Od. 3.256</span></i>
          <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">; εἴπερ γάρ τε χόλον γε καὶ αὐτῆμαρ
            καταπέψῃ</span> | <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">ἀλλά τε καὶ μετόπισθεν
            ἔχει κότον</span>, ‘though he swallow his <span class="alpheios-lex-gloss">wrath</span>...
          yet he retains a grudge, etc.,’ <i><span class="en">Il.
            1.81</span></i>; hence <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">γε</span> may convert a
          slight word into a strong one, lending, as it does, another syllable,
          and preserving the acute tone, <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">ὃ</span>
          becomes <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">ὅ γε, δὲ</span> becomes <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">δέ γε</span>, etc.; even by preventing elision it is
          a means of force, you may call it a ‘stop-gap,’ yet it is not otiose.
          With other particles, <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">ἄρα γε, εἴ γε, πρίν γε,
            πάρος γε, ἐπεί γε</span>, etc.; freq. in neg. sentences, where it
          may sometimes be translated by an interjected <span class="alpheios-lex-gloss">no</span>, as in
          affirmative sentences occasionally by <span class="alpheios-lex-gloss">yes.</span> For
          repetition of <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">γέ</span>, cf. <i><span class="en">Il. 5.287</span></i> f.</div> <div class="alpheios-lex-footnotes en"> </div>
