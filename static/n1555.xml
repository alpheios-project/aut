          <b><span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">ἀσπίς</span></b> , <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">ίδος</span>: <span class="alpheios-lex-gloss">shield.</span>—(1) the larger, oval shield,
          termed <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">ἀμφιβρότη, ποδηνεκής</span>. It is
          more than 2 ft. broad, 4 1/2 ft. high, and weighed about 40 lbs. (For
          Agamemnon's shield, see <i><span class="en">Il. 11.32</span></i>-40).
          The large shield was held over the left shoulder, sustained by the
            <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">τελαμών</span> and by the <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">πόρπαξ</span>, or ring on the inside.— (2) the
          smaller, circular shield, <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">πάντοσ᾽
            ἐί̄ση</span> (see cut), with only two handles, or with one
          central handle for the arm and several for the hand (see cut No. 12).
          It was of about half the size and weight of the larger <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">ἀσπίς</span>, cf. the description of Sarpēdon's
          shield, <i><span class="en">Il. 12.294</span></i> ff. The shield
          consisted generally of from 4 to 7 layers of ox-hide (<span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">ῥῑνοί</span>, <i><span class="en">Il.
            13.804</span></i>); these were covered by a plate of metal, and the
          whole was firmly united by rivets, which projected on the outer,
          convex side. The head of the central rivet, larger than the rest, was
          the <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">ὀμφαλός</span> or <span class="alpheios-lex-gloss">boss</span>,
          and was usually fashioned into the form of a head. Instead of the
          plate above mentioned, concentric metal rings (<span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">δινωτής, εὔκυκλος</span>) were sometimes substituted. The rim
          was called <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">ἄντυξ</span>, and the convex
          surface of the shield bore some device analogous to an heraldic coat
          of arms, <i><span class="en">Il. 5.182</span></i>, <i><span class="en">Il. 11.36</span></i>, cf. <i><span class="en">Il. 5.739</span></i>. The shield of Achilles (<i><span class="en">Il. 18.478</span></i>-608), in describing which the poet naturally did
          not choose to confine himself to realities, does not correspond
          exactly to either of the two <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">ἀσπίδες</span>
          described above.
