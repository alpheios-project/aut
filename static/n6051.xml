          of Oeneus and Althaea, husband of Cleopatra, the slayer of the
          Calydonian boar. A quarrel arose between the Curētes of Pleuron and

          upper hand until Meleāger withdrew from the struggle in consequence of
          the curses of his mother. But he was afterwards induced by his wife to
          enter the conflict again, and he drove the Curētes vanquished into
