          correlative word, but always (except when meaning ‘but not’) adding a
          new negation after a previous one expressed or implied; if <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">οὐδέ</span> occurs at the beginning of several
          successive clauses, the first one refers to some previous negation
          just as much as the 2d or the 3d, <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">Τηλέμαχ̓, οὐδ᾽

          to write <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">οὐ δέ</span> separately, as this
          usage is essentially different from the other one. See <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">μηδέ</span>.)</div> <div class="alpheios-lex-footnotes en"> </div>
