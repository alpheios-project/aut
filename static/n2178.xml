          strictly neither adversative nor copulative, but used to
            <span class="alpheios-lex-gloss">offset</span> statements or parts of statements; such
          offsetting or coördination (‘parataxis’) by means of <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">δέ</span>, when it appears in place of the to us
          more familiar subordination of ideas (‘hypotaxis’), gives rise to the
          translation ‘while,’ ‘though,’ ‘for,’ etc. Hence <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">δέ</span> appears even in the apodosis of conditional or
          temporal sentences, <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">οἳ δ᾽ ἐπεὶ οὖν ἤγερθεν..
            τοῖσι δ̓ ἀνιστάμενος μετέφη</span>, when they were all assembled,
          ‘then’ arose Achilles, <i><span class="en">Il. 1.57</span></i>, 137.
          The other extreme, of an apparently adversative force, is best seen in
          negative sentences where <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">δέ</span> is
          (rarely) used for <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">ἀλλά</span>, <i><span class="en">Od. 9.145</span></i>. With other particles, <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">καὶ</span> (‘also’) <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">δέ</span>, (<span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">δέ</span>) <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">τε, ἄρα, αὖ, δή. δέ</span> is placed as second (or
          third) word in its clause, but a vocative is not counted, <i><span class="en">Od. 3.247</span></i>.</div> <div class="alpheios-lex-footnotes en"> </div>
