          <b><span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">παρά, παραί, πάρ</span></b> :
            <span class="alpheios-lex-gloss">beside, by.</span>—I. adv. (here belong all instances of the
          so - called ‘tmesis’), written <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">πάρα</span>
          (‘anastrophe’) when placed after the verb it modifies, or when the
          verb is not expressed; <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">ἐτίθει πάρα πᾶσαν
            ἐδωδήν</span>, placed food ‘beside’ (we should say ‘before’) him,
            <i><span class="en">Od. 5.196</span></i>
          <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">; πάρ ῥ̓ ἄκυλον βάλεν</span>, threw ‘down,’
          we should say, <i><span class="en">Od. 10.242</span></i>
          <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">; παρά μ᾽ ἤπαφε δαίμων</span>, deceived and
          led me ‘astray’ (cf. our ‘beside oneself’), <i><span class="en">Od. 14.488</span></i>. The relation of the adv. may be made more
          specific by the addition of an appropriate case of a subst. in the
          same sentence, thus showing the transition to the true prepositional
          usage, <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">πὰρ δ᾽ ἴσαν Ὠκεανοῦ ῥοά̄ς</span> (acc.
          of extent of space), <i><span class="en">Od. 24.11</span></i>.—II.
          prep. (1) w. gen., <span class="alpheios-lex-gloss">from beside, from;</span>
          <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">φάσγανον παρὰ μηροῦ ἐρύσσασθαι, παρά τινος
            ἔρχεσθαι</span>, often ‘from one's house,’ <i><span class="en">Il. 21.444</span></i>; then to denote the giver,
          author, <i><span class="en">Od. 6.290</span></i>, <i><span class="en">Il. 11.795</span></i>.—(2) w. dat., of rest or
          position beside, but also where a certain amount of motion is meant,
          as with verbs of placing, sitting, falling, <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">θεῖναι, πεσεῖν παρά τινι, Ν 617</span>, <i><span class="en">Od. 15.285</span></i>; then of possession, keeping,
            <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">πὰρ κεινοῖσιν ἐμὸν γέρας</span>, ‘in their
          hands,’ <i><span class="en">Od. 11.175</span></i>.—(3) w. acc.,
            <span class="alpheios-lex-gloss">to the side of, unto, along by, beyond</span>, implying
          motion, though sometimes very faintly, <i><span class="en">Il.
            1.463</span></i>
          <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">; τύψε κατὰ κληῖδα παρ᾽ αὐχένα</span>, motion
          implied in the mere act of striking, <i><span class="en">Il.
            21.117</span></i>
          <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">; βῆναι παρὰ θι&lt;&gt;͂να</span>,
          ‘along the shore’; <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">στῆναι παρά τινα</span>,
          ‘come and stand by one’; then the thought of over-passing,
          over-stepping, transgressing, <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">πὰρ δύναμιν, παρὰ
            μοῖραν</span>, ‘contrary to right,’ <i><span class="en">Od.
            14.509</span></i>.—As a prep. also <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">πάρα</span>
          is written with anastrophe when standing after its case, unless there
          is elision, <i><span class="en">Od. 18.315</span></i>.—In
          composition <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">παρά</span> has the meanings
          above given, but that of winning over (persuading from one side to the
          other), leading ‘astray,’ ‘amiss’ (also in good sense) by words, etc.,
          is particularly to be noted.</div> <div class="alpheios-lex-footnotes en"> </div>
