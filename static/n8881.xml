            <span class="alpheios-lex-gloss">Telemachus</span>, the son of Odysseus and Penelope. The
          name (‘Afar - fighting’) was given to the child because he was born as
          his father was about to depart for the war of Troy. Telemachus is the
          principal figure in the first four books of the Odyssey, and his
          journey in quest of tidings of his father to Pylos and Sparta, under
          the guidance of Athēna in the form of Mentor, has made the name of his
          ‘mentor’ proverbial. After the return of Odysseus, Telemachus assists
          him in taking revenge upon the suitors. He is mentioned in the Iliad
          only in <i><span class="en">Il. 2.260</span></i>, <i><span class="en">Il. 4.354</span></i>.</div> <div class="alpheios-lex-footnotes en"> </div>
