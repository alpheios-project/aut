          daughter of Tantalus and wife of Amphīon, king of Thebes. Her six sons
          were slain by the arrows of Apollo, and her six daughters by the
          arrows of Artemis, because she had presumed to compare her children
          with those of Leto. Niobe in grief was changed into stone, a legend
          that connects itself with a natural conformation in the rock of Mt.
          Sipylus, which resembles a woman in a sitting posture, <i><span class="en">Il. 24.602</span></i>, 606.</div> <div class="alpheios-lex-footnotes en"> </div>
