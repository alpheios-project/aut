          <b><span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">μηδέ</span></b> : <span class="alpheios-lex-gloss">but not. and not,
            nor, not even, not at all;</span>
          <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">μηδέ</span> always introduces an additional
          negation, after some negative idea has already been expressed or
          implied. It is never a correlative word; if more than one <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">μηδέ</span> occurs at the beginning of successive
          clauses, the first <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">μηδέ</span> refers to some
          previous negative idea just as much as the second one or the third one
          does; <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">μηδέ τις.. οἶος μεμάτω μάχεσθαι, μηδ᾽
            ἀναχωρείτω</span>, <i><span class="en">Il. 4.303</span></i>;
          here the first <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">μηδέ</span> means <span class="alpheios-lex-gloss">and
            not, nor</span>, the direct quotation being regarded as a
          continuation of what precedes in the indirect form. Usually <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">μηδέ</span> at the beginning of a sentence means
            <span class="alpheios-lex-gloss">not even</span> or <span class="alpheios-lex-gloss">not at all.</span> For the
          difference between <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">μηδέ</span> and <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">οὐδέ</span>, see <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">μή</span>.
