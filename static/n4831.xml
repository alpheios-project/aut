            ἐπίτονοι</span>. During stay in port the mast was unstepped and
          laid back upon the <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">ἱστοδόκη</span> (cf.
          preceding cut, and Nos. 60, 84).—(2) <span class="alpheios-lex-gloss">weaver's beam,
            loom.</span> The frame of the loom was not placed, as in modern
          handlooms, in a horizontal position, but stood upright, as appears in
          the cut, representing an ancient Egyptian loom. The threads of the
          warp hung perpendicularly down, and were drawn tight by weights at
          their lower ends. To set up the beam and so begin the web is (<span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">ἱστὸν</span>) <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">στήσασθαι</span>. In weaving, the weaver passed from one side to
          the other before the loom (<span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">ἐποίχεσθαι</span>), as he carried the shuttle (<span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">κανών</span>), on which was wound the thread of the
          woof, through the warp, and then drove the woof home with a blow of
          the <span class="alpheios-lex-greek" lang="grc">κερκίς</span>.— (3) <span class="alpheios-lex-gloss">warp</span>,
