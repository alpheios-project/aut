            <span class="alpheios-lex-gloss">chaplet</span> or <span class="alpheios-lex-gloss">fillet</span> of a priest. Chryses
          takes the fillet from his head and places it upon his sceptre, because
          he comes as a suppliant, <i><span class="en">Il. 1.14</span></i>. (The
          cut shows the band in two positions—as extended at full length, and as
          wrapped around the head. In the second representation the ends should
          hang down by the sides of the head below the ears, <i><span class="en">Il. 1.28</span></i>.)
